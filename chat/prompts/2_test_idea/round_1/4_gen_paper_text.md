<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A research paper writer (Step 3.4: GEN_PAPER_TEXT in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, all artifacts, the previous paper draft (if any), and reviewer feedback.
Write a complete paper draft with figure placeholders.

Publication-quality paper → strong contribution. Weak paper → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<research_methodology>
Write like a researcher drafting a paper, not a chatbot summarizing bullet points.

- Structure as a paper would: research question → methodology → results → analysis → limitations. Not a list of "we did X, then Y."
- Ground every claim in specific artifacts and specific numbers. "Results show improvement" is empty — state effect sizes, baselines, and conditions.
- Be honest about what worked, what didn't, and why. Don't spin failures as "future work."
- The paper's headline contribution should be a positive or surprising finding. Negative results are valuable context but should not be the primary narrative — lead with what works.
- Address reviewer feedback from previous iterations explicitly — show you've thought about each critique.
</research_methodology>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_42Eo0dleXOQf/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_paper_text/gen_paper_text`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_42Eo0dleXOQf/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_paper_text/gen_paper_text/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_42Eo0dleXOQf/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_paper_text/gen_paper_text/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_42Eo0dleXOQf/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_paper_text/gen_paper_text/results/out.json`

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for related-work positioning and how this field frames a genuinely novel contribution.

<writing_register>
Write in the register of the field's best papers (the passages you collect in the STYLE EXEMPLARS todo), not in the register of a language
model. Four things are measured on the finished draft, and a draft outside them is sent back with
the numbers:
- Never use: delve, underscore, showcase, intricate, pivotal, realm, commendable, meticulous, tapestry, garner, multifaceted, it is worth noting, plays a crucial role, not only ... but also. These are 10 to 30 times more frequent in machine-written abstracts than in
  human ones, and reviewers read them as such.
- Em dashes: at most 3 per 1,000 words. Use a comma, a colon or a full stop.
- Sentence rhythm: mix short and long sentences. An interquartile range of sentence length under
  8 words reads as machine-written.
- Hedging: at most 15 hedges (may, likely, suggests, appears) per 1,000
  words. State what the evidence supports plainly; hedge where it is thin, not everywhere.
Style never changes substance: numbers, claims, citations and figure markers stay exactly as the
evidence gives them. The user's original request (delivered as a separate message) overrides all
of this wherever the two conflict.

<hypothesis>
The research hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Language Minimizes Dependency-Distance Tail Risk
hypothesis: >-
  Dependency distance minimization (DDM) across languages operates predominantly on the upper tail of the dependency-length
  distribution rather than on its central tendency: registers, typologies, and families that look similar in mean dependency
  distance (MDD) will differ systematically in the extreme-value tail index (the Generalized Pareto shape parameter ξ fitted
  to sentence-length-normalized dependency lengths above a high threshold via peaks-over-threshold), and this tail index —
  not MDD — is the statistic that best separates spoken from written registers and best tracks morphosyntactic typology (head-finality,
  case-marking richness, free word order).
motivation: >-
  Sixty years of DDM research (Hawkins, Liu, Futrell, Temperley & Gildea, and the recent UD-wide functional/lexical split)
  has almost exclusively summarized dependency-length distributions by their mean or median, or tested full-distribution fits
  (power law vs. lognormal) against a null. None of this asks the question that memory-load theory actually predicts: working-memory
  failure is a threshold phenomenon (a dependency becomes unrecoverable once it exceeds some integration-cost budget), so
  the linguistically consequential quantity is how fast the probability of an extreme (rare, very long) dependency decays
  — exactly the object extreme value theory (EVT) was built to characterize in finance, hydrology, and reliability engineering,
  where the mean of a loss/flood/failure-time distribution is known to be a poor guide to catastrophic-tail behavior. If spoken
  language minimizes memory load harder than written language, that pressure should show up first and most cleanly as a lighter,
  more bounded tail (fewer syntactic 'shocks'), even in cases where mean DD looks similar because the bulk of short local
  dependencies dominates the mean. This reframes DDM from a central-tendency phenomenon to a risk-management phenomenon, giving
  quantitative typologists a new, theoretically motivated statistic (ξ) that is orthogonal to MDD and may explain family-level
  DDM anomalies that mean-based measures cannot.
assumptions:
- >-
  CoNLL-U dependency arcs and token linear order in UD treebanks are reliable enough (post length ≥ 500-sentence, LAS/UPOS
  quality filters) to compute dependency distances without treebank-specific annotation artifacts dominating the tail
- >-
  Sentence-length-normalized dependency distance (e.g., distance divided by sentence length, or distance conditioned on sentence-length
  quantile) is an adequate control for the mechanical fact that longer sentences permit longer arcs, so that a POT/GPD fit
  on the normalized variable targets genuine tail risk rather than a sentence-length artifact
- >-
  The 12 fully-spoken UD treebanks plus their written-register counterparts in the same language (where available, e.g. Slovenian
  SST vs. SSJ, French Rhapsodie/Spoken vs. GSD, English) provide enough tokens per treebank (≥ 20k dependency arcs) for a
  stable peaks-over-threshold tail fit
- >-
  Typological features (head-finality ratio, case system size, flexible word order) sourced from UD's own morphological features
  plus WALS/Grambank are accurate enough at the treebank level to serve as covariates in a mixed-effects model
- >-
  A treebank's tail index is a property of the language/register's production system and not purely an artifact of a single
  annotator's segmentation choices for coordination/apposition, which will be checked via a sensitivity analysis excluding
  flat/list-type relations
investigation_approach: >-
  Using HuggingFace's commul/universal_dependencies (all UD v2 treebanks), extract every token's dependency-to-head linear
  distance from CoNLL-U trees for every treebank meeting a minimum-size threshold, tag each treebank by register (fully-spoken
  vs. written vs. mixed, from the UD documentation and the LRE 2022 spoken-treebank survey) and by typological covariates.
  For each treebank compute (a) classical MDD/optimality-ratio baselines (permutation nulls, as in prior DDM work, for continuity
  with the literature) and (b) a peaks-over-threshold extreme value fit: choose a threshold via a mean-residual-life plot,
  fit a Generalized Pareto Distribution to sentence-length-normalized excess dependency lengths via maximum likelihood (scipy.stats.genpareto),
  and bootstrap confidence intervals on the shape parameter ξ. Fit a Bayesian/linear mixed-effects model with ξ (and separately
  MDD) as outcome, register (spoken/written) and typological features as fixed effects, and language family as a random effect,
  to test whether register predicts ξ after controlling for MDD, and vice versa — establishing whether the two statistics
  carry independent information. Use same-language spoken/written treebank pairs as a matched within-language design to isolate
  the register effect from cross-language typological confounds. Identify family/language outliers as treebanks whose ξ residual
  (after the typology-only model) exceeds a pre-registered threshold, and manually inspect a sample of their extreme-tail
  sentences for a syntactic explanation (e.g. extraposition, long-distance relative clauses, free-word-order scrambling).
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMS the hypothesis if: (1) within matched same-language spoken/written pairs, ξ is significantly lower (lighter tail,
  tighter upper bound) for spoken treebanks in a majority of pairs, even in pairs where MDD differences are small or non-significant;
  (2) the mixed-effects model shows register remains a significant predictor of ξ after controlling for MDD (i.e. ξ carries
  information MDD does not); (3) typological covariates (e.g. head-finality, case richness) explain a comparable or greater
  share of variance in ξ as they do in MDD, replicating known typology-DDM links but on a genuinely new axis. DISCONFIRMS
  / yields the phenomenological-anomaly finding instead if ξ is statistically indistinguishable from what MDD alone predicts
  (tail and center move together, no new information), or if spoken/written differences in ξ are inconsistent in direction
  across language pairs — in which case the paper reports ξ as a new descriptive typological statistic and characterizes which
  families deviate from the MDD-based expectation, satisfying the level-3 'surface and characterize a new empirical regularity'
  ambition even without full confirmation.
related_works:
- >-
  Futrell, Mahowald & Gibson (2015), 'Large-scale evidence of dependency length minimization': establishes DDM as a cross-language
  universal via mean dependency length against random baselines across ~37 languages; uses only central-tendency statistics,
  no tail/extreme-value analysis, and does not compare registers within a language.
- >-
  Temperley & Gildea (2018), 'Minimizing Syntactic Dependency Lengths: Typological/Psycholinguistic Evidence': the standard
  survey of DDM measures (MDD, optimality ratios, Hawkins' domain minimization); catalogs mean- and distribution-shape statistics
  (power-law/lognormal fits) but never a peaks-over-threshold/GPD tail-risk framing.
- >-
  'The Grammar Does the Work: Functional vs. Lexical Dependency Length Minimization Across Universal Dependencies' (2026,
  122 UD/SUD languages): the most recent and largest-scale UD-wide DDM study; splits dependencies into functional vs. lexical
  classes and uses MDD, Wilcoxon tests, and mixed-effects models with word-order/family covariates — confirmed via direct
  fetch to use no extreme value theory, survival analysis, or tail-index modeling, and to not compare spoken vs. written registers,
  leaving both gaps this hypothesis fills.
- >-
  Dobrovoljc (2022), 'Spoken Language Treebanks in Universal Dependencies: an Overview': surveys the 12 (of 228) fully-spoken
  UD treebanks and documents annotation-scheme heterogeneity for speech disfluencies — essential background for register coding
  and quality filtering, but a resource/survey paper, not a DDM study.
- >-
  Jiang & Liu (2015) and related spoken-vs-written Mandarin dependency-distance studies: compare mean dependency distance
  between speech and text in single languages using conventional MDD statistics; this hypothesis differs by (a) using the
  tail/shape statistic rather than the mean as the primary register discriminant, and (b) scaling the comparison across many
  UD languages/families with typology as an explicit covariate rather than a single-language case study.
inspiration: >-
  CONCEPTUAL: from finance and hydrology, the idea that a distribution's mean is a poor and sometimes misleading summary of
  risk, and that the object worth modeling is the tail — 'what does the worst 1% look like, and how fast does its probability
  decay' — reframes DDM's 'minimize load' claim as a claim about extreme-event suppression rather than average-case efficiency,
  which is a more direct read of the working-memory-failure mechanism DDM theory actually invokes. METHODOLOGICAL: the peaks-over-threshold
  / Generalized Pareto Distribution machinery from extreme value theory (mean-residual-life threshold selection, GPD shape-parameter
  MLE, POT bootstrap CIs), imported essentially as-is from its standard use in flood-frequency and operational-risk analysis,
  applied here to sentence-length-normalized dependency lengths in place of the power-law/lognormal whole-distribution fits
  or simple percentile cutoffs that quantitative typology currently uses. This stays close to methodology the field already
  trusts (mixed-effects models with family random effects, permutation-based null baselines, matched within-language register
  comparisons — all Dobrovoljc-familiar tools) while adding one genuinely new statistic (ξ) rather than a wholesale new framework.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance (DD)
  definition: >-
    For a word and its syntactic head in a dependency tree, the absolute difference in their linear positions in the sentence
    (number of words between them + 1); dependency length minimization (DLM/DDM) is the observed cross-linguistic tendency
    for actual sentences to have shorter total/mean dependency distance than random or alternative orderings of the same tree.
- term: Mean Dependency Distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The standard summary statistic in DDM research: the average dependency distance across all arcs in a sentence or corpus,
    typically compared to a permutation-generated random baseline via an 'optimality ratio'.
- term: Extreme Value Theory (EVT)
  definition: >-
    A branch of statistics dealing with the stochastic behavior of extreme deviations from the median of probability distributions,
    originally developed for engineering and environmental risk (e.g. flood levels, material failure) where average behavior
    is uninformative about rare catastrophic events.
- term: Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT)
  definition: >-
    An EVT method that models all observations exceeding a sufficiently high threshold, rather than only block maxima, using
    the Generalized Pareto Distribution — more data-efficient than block-maxima EVT and standard practice for tail modeling
    of moderate-sized empirical samples.
- term: Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) shape parameter ξ
  definition: >-
    The parameter governing the tail's heaviness in a POT fit: ξ > 0 means an unbounded, heavy (power-law-like) tail; ξ =
    0 means an exponentially-decaying tail; ξ < 0 means a bounded tail with a hard upper limit. Used here as the 'tail risk'
    statistic for dependency lengths, analogous to its use for insurance losses or extreme rainfall.
- term: Head-finality / typological covariates
  definition: >-
    Morphosyntactic properties of a language extracted from UD morphological annotations and typological databases (WALS/Grambank):
    whether heads systematically follow their dependents (OV-type order), the size/productivity of the case-marking system,
    and the degree of word-order flexibility — all previously linked to MDD and hypothesized here to also predict tail shape.
summary: >-
  Instead of measuring dependency-length minimization by its mean (as all prior UD-wide studies do), this hypothesis applies
  extreme-value peaks-over-threshold statistics to fit a tail-risk shape parameter to dependency-length distributions across
  UD treebanks, testing whether spoken language and typologically 'harder' languages minimize catastrophic long-distance dependencies
  specifically, in a way plain mean-distance measures miss or contradict.

title: UD Dependency Distances by Register and Typology
summary: >-
  full_data_out.json (schema exp_sel_data_out, 33,030 examples, 58MB) holds one 'ud_treebanks' group built from 18 Universal
  Dependencies v2.18 treebanks (universal-dependencies/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace, alias commul/universal_dependencies),
  evenly subsampled to <=2000 sentences per treebank to stay under the 100MB limit while preserving document-order representativeness
  (full unsampled treebanks remain in temp/datasets/ for re-extraction). Coverage includes three matched spoken/written register
  pairs in the same language (Slovenian SST[spoken]/SSJ[written], French Rhapsodie[spoken]/GSD[written], English ESLSpok[spoken]/EWT[written]/GUM[mixed])
  plus nine typologically diverse written/mixed treebanks (Turkish ATIS[spoken, task-oriented]/IMST[written], Arabic PADT,
  Japanese GSD, Korean GSD, Hindi HDTB, Finnish TDT, Chinese GSD, Russian SynTagRus, Nigerian Pidgin NSC, Neapolitan RB) spanning
  head-initial/head-final word orders, case-rich/case-poor morphology, and multiple language families (Indo-European, Turkic,
  Afro-Asiatic, Japonic, Koreanic, Uralic, Sino-Tibetan, Creole). Each example is one CoNLL-U sentence: `input` is a JSON
  string with treebank_id, surface text, tokens, and UPOS tags; `output` is a JSON string with per-arc dependency_distances
  (|dependent_position - head_position|, 1-indexed, artificial ROOT.0 arc excluded), sentence-length-normalized_distances,
  heads, and deprels -- everything needed for peaks-over-threshold / extreme-value analysis of Dependency Distance Minimization
  (DDM). Flat metadata_* fields carry treebank_id, language, ISO 639-3 code, language family, register (spoken/written/mixed),
  sentence_id, row_index, sentence_length, num_arcs, mean dependency distance, mean normalized distance, and head_finality_ratio
  (fraction of arcs where head follows dependent) -- all computed directly from the CoNLL-U head column, no external library
  dependency. 27,012 of the 33,030 examples (10 of 18 covered languages) additionally carry metadata_grambank_features: a
  JSON string of a 15-feature core morphosyntax subset (case/agreement/word-order-adjacent WALS-style features) from Grambank
  v1.0.3 (Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7740139, CLDF format, 2,467 languages x 195 features), joined by language name since Grambank
  is language-level, not treebank-level -- both registers of the same language deliberately share identical typology values
  (the within-language matched design the artifact plan calls for). Languages without a Grambank match get metadata_grambank_features=null
  rather than an imputed value. Downstream experiment code should: (1) group by metadata_language + metadata_register to compare
  spoken-vs-written DDM; (2) use metadata_language_family and metadata_grambank_features as typological covariates/moderators;
  (3) fit extreme-value/POT models on metadata_mean_normalized_distance or the full per-sentence normalized_distances arrays
  in `output`; (4) be aware sample sizes are capped at 2000 sentences/treebank (nap_rb has only 20 -- its only available split)
  which bounds tail-estimation precision for the smallest treebanks. Raw untruncated treebank JSON (all splits, full sentence
  counts) is preserved at temp/datasets/full_universal-dependencies_universal_dependencies_<treebank>_<split>.json for any
  re-extraction at larger scale, and the full Grambank CLDF tables (values.csv, languages.csv, parameters.csv, codes.csv,
  families.csv) are at temp/datasets/grambank/grambank-grambank-7ae000c/cldf/ for pulling additional features beyond the core
  15 if needed.

title: Tail Index vs Mean Dependency Distance
summary: >-
  Statistically evaluates whether the GPD peaks-over-threshold tail index (xi) of dependency distances carries information
  beyond mean dependency distance (MDD) for distinguishing spoken/written register and predicting typology, across 18 UD treebanks
  (18 treebanks, 33,030 sentences, 558,144 arcs, 8 language families). gen_art_experiment_1 crashed and wrote no output at
  all, so eval.py computes xi (POT-GPD fit at 75th/80th/90th percentile thresholds) and MDD itself directly from gen_art_dataset_1's
  already-collected per-sentence raw dependency distances -- a cheap, deterministic, non-LLM aggregation, not a re-run of
  the experiment -- and records this substitution transparently in the output metadata. Because gen_art_dataset_1 was observed
  being rewritten in place by a concurrent process mid-session, the dataset was snapshotted into this workspace (full_data_out_snapshot.json)
  before use, and the Grambank case-marking/word-order codes needed (GB070-073, GB075/133/328/422 -- absent from the dataset's
  own embedded feature subset) were extracted once from the raw Grambank CLDF release into typology_grambank.json. Implements
  all 8 evaluation components from the plan: (1) mixed-effects model comparison (xi~MDD vs xi~register+MDD) via AICc/Akaike
  weights and marginal/conditional R2 gain; (2) a 4-predictor variance-partitioning model with standardized slopes, 95% CIs
  and semi-partial R2; (3) within-language paired register comparisons -- both a descriptive 4-pair (sl/fr/en/tr) direction
  tally and a properly-powered sentence-length-decile-matched Wilcoxon signed-rank test on normalized dependency distance;
  (4) leave-one-family-out cross-validation over 8 families with bootstrapped macro RMSE/MAE/MAPE for both xi and MDD; (5)
  marginal and partial (register-controlled) Spearman correlations between xi/MDD and 3 typological features (empirical head-finality,
  Grambank case-richness, empirical word-order flexibility) with Holm-Bonferroni correction across 6 tests; (6) outlier detection
  via standardized residuals from the full mixed model plus a deterministic, rule-based (not manual/LLM) categorization of
  each flagged treebank's extreme-tail sentences into extraposition/long-distance-RC/free-word-order/disfluency/coordination/other;
  (7) sensitivity analysis excluding flat/list/conj/appos arcs, excluding treebanks under 20k arcs, and a 75/80/90th-percentile
  GPD threshold sweep; (8) Shapiro-Wilk normality, singular-fit flags, and residual-homogeneity diagnostics. Because 8 families
  span only 18 treebanks (several singleton families), most random-intercept models are not identifiable; fit_mixedlm tries
  4 optimizers and then falls back to fixed-effects-only OLS (family variance forced to 0), flagged singular=True with the
  concrete reason rather than silently dropping the model, so callers still get real AIC/BIC/coefficients. Key results: register
  improves fit over MDD-only (delta AICc favors Model 2, register p=0.0019, R2_marginal gain +0.089); the length-bin-matched
  Wilcoxon test is significant (p=0.008, 64% of length-bins show spoken > written normalized distance) even though the small-n
  (4 pairs) treebank-level tally is mixed (25% spoken<written on xi, 50% on MDD); LOFO-CV shows xi generalizes with macro
  RMSE 0.067 (MAPE ~77%, reflecting xi's small absolute scale) vs MDD's RMSE 0.51; xi correlates with head-finality (partial
  rho -0.55) more strongly than MDD does (partial rho -0.29), supporting typological co-predictivity; no treebank was flagged
  as a >2-sigma outlier in this run. All limitations (small-n pairs, unidentifiable random effects, incomplete Grambank coverage
  for 3/18 treebanks, rule-based rather than manual outlier categorization) are reported explicitly in the output rather than
  hidden. Produces eval.py, eval_out.json/full/mini/preview, typology_grambank.json, and a snapshot of the input dataset.

  (fraction of arcs where head follows dependent) -- all computed directly from the CoNLL-U head column, no external library
  dependency. 27,012 of the 33,030 examples (10 of 18 covered languages) additionally carry metadata_grambank_features: a
  JSON string of a 15-feature core morphosyntax subset (case/agreement/word-order-adjacent WALS-style features) from Grambank
  v1.0.3 (Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7740139, CLDF format, 2,467 languages x 195 features), joined by language name since Grambank
  is language-level, not treebank-level -- both registers of the same language deliberately share identical typology values
  (the within-language matched design the artifact plan calls for). Languages without a Grambank match get metadata_grambank_features=null
  rather than an imputed value. Downstream experiment code should: (1) group by metadata_language + metadata_register to compare
  spoken-vs-written DDM; (2) use metadata_language_family and metadata_grambank_features as typological covariates/moderators;
  (3) fit extreme-value/POT models on metadata_mean_normalized_distance or the full per-sentence normalized_distances arrays
  in `output`; (4) be aware sample sizes are capped at 2000 sentences/treebank (nap_rb has only 20 -- its only available split)
  which bounds tail-estimation precision for the smallest treebanks. Raw untruncated treebank JSON (all splits, full sentence
  counts) is preserved at temp/datasets/full_universal-dependencies_universal_dependencies_<treebank>_<split>.json for any
  re-extraction at larger scale, and the full Grambank CLDF tables (values.csv, languages.csv, parameters.csv, codes.csv,
  families.csv) are at temp/datasets/grambank/grambank-grambank-7ae000c/cldf/ for pulling additional features beyond the core
  15 if needed.

title: Tail Index vs Mean Dependency Distance
id: art_2GNqt0jTCVii
summary: >-
  Statistically evaluates whether the GPD peaks-over-threshold tail index (xi) of dependency distances carries information
  beyond mean dependency distance (MDD) for distinguishing spoken/written register and predicting typology, across 18 UD treebanks
  (18 treebanks, 33,030 sentences, 558,144 arcs, 8 language families). gen_art_experiment_1 crashed and wrote no output at
  all, so eval.py computes xi (POT-GPD fit at 75th/80th/90th percentile thresholds) and MDD itself directly from gen_art_dataset_1's
  already-collected per-sentence raw dependency distances -- a cheap, deterministic, non-LLM aggregation, not a re-run of
  the experiment -- and records this substitution transparently in the output metadata. Because gen_art_dataset_1 was observed
  being rewritten in place by a concurrent process mid-session, the dataset was snapshotted into this workspace (full_data_out_snapshot.json)
  before use, and the Grambank case-marking/word-order codes needed (GB070-073, GB075/133/328/422 -- absent from the dataset's
  own embedded feature subset) were extracted once from the raw Grambank CLDF release into typology_grambank.json. Implements
  all 8 evaluation components from the plan: (1) mixed-effects model comparison (xi~MDD vs xi~register+MDD) via AICc/Akaike
  weights and marginal/conditional R2 gain; (2) a 4-predictor variance-partitioning model with standardized slopes, 95% CIs
  and semi-partial R2; (3) within-language paired register comparisons -- both a descriptive 4-pair (sl/fr/en/tr) direction
  tally and a properly-powered sentence-length-decile-matched Wilcoxon signed-rank test on normalized dependency distance;
  (4) leave-one-family-out cross-validation over 8 families with bootstrapped macro RMSE/MAE/MAPE for both xi and MDD; (5)
  marginal and partial (register-controlled) Spearman correlations between xi/MDD and 3 typological features (empirical head-finality,
  Grambank case-richness, empirical word-order flexibility) with Holm-Bonferroni correction across 6 tests; (6) outlier detection
  via standardized residuals from the full mixed model plus a deterministic, rule-based (not manual/LLM) categorization of
  each flagged treebank's extreme-tail sentences into extraposition/long-distance-RC/free-word-order/disfluency/coordination/other;
  (7) sensitivity analysis excluding flat/list/conj/appos arcs, excluding treebanks under 20k arcs, and a 75/80/90th-percentile
  GPD threshold sweep; (8) Shapiro-Wilk normality, singular-fit flags, and residual-homogeneity diagnostics. Because 8 families
  span only 18 treebanks (several singleton families), most random-intercept models are not identifiable; fit_mixedlm tries
  4 optimizers and then falls back to fixed-effects-only OLS (family variance forced to 0), flagged singular=True with the
  concrete reason rather than silently dropping the model, so callers still get real AIC/BIC/coefficients. Key results: register
  improves fit over MDD-only (delta AICc favors Model 2, register p=0.0019, R2_marginal gain +0.089); the length-bin-matched
  Wilcoxon test is significant (p=0.008, 64% of length-bins show spoken > written normalized distance) even though the small-n
  (4 pairs) treebank-level tally is mixed (25% spoken<written on xi, 50% on MDD); LOFO-CV shows xi generalizes with macro
  RMSE 0.067 (MAPE ~77%, reflecting xi's small absolute scale) vs MDD's RMSE 0.51; xi correlates with head-finality (partial
  rho -0.55) more strongly than MDD does (partial rho -0.29), supporting typological co-predictivity; no treebank was flagged
  as a >2-sigma outlier in this run. All limitations (small-n pairs, unidentifiable random effects, incomplete Grambank coverage
  for 3/18 treebanks, rule-based rather than manual outlier categorization) are reported explicitly in the output rather than
  hidden. Produces eval.py, eval_out.json/full/mini/preview, typology_grambank.json, and a snapshot of the input dataset.

<data_files>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_files>

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

This is the FIRST paper draft. Write a complete research paper from scratch based on the hypothesis and all available artifacts.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

FIGURE TYPE — set `figure_type` on every figure. One test decides it: does the figure plot numbers?
  "data"    — a DATA FIGURE: bars, curves, scatter, heatmaps, confusion matrices, scaling
              laws, distributions, Pareto fronts, ablation deltas. Rendered deterministically
              from the values you supply, so every bar is exactly the height of its number.
  "concept" — a CONCEPT FIGURE: conceptual artwork, architecture and flow diagrams, anything
              with no underlying dataset. Drawn by an image model.
If the figure has real numbers behind it, ALWAYS use "data". An image model only approximates
values: the bars come back close to, but not equal to, the numbers you asked for, and nothing
downstream detects it.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison — plots numbers, so a data figure):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "figure_type": "data", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero — no dataset, so a concept figure):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "figure_type": "concept", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description. For a "data" figure, list the values per series
plus the axis labels and units; the renderer needs the numbers themselves, not a description of
what they look like.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib, aii-web-tools.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. STYLE EXEMPLARS: Decide which field or fields this paper belongs to; a paper spanning two
fields takes exemplars from both. If `./style_exemplars.md` already exists in your workspace
(a previous iteration wrote it), read it and skip the search. Otherwise use the aii-web-tools
skill's scholarly search (OpenAlex) to find the best-cited open-access papers of the last five
years closest to this paper, fetch four or five of them through the skill's fetch tool (arXiv HTML
or PDF), and copy VERBATIM into `./style_exemplars.md`, each passage headed by the paper's
title, year and URL: the abstract, the first paragraph of the introduction, one results paragraph
that reports numbers, and one discussion or limitations paragraph. Read the file once as a whole
and put one line at its top on how those papers handle sentence length, hedging, first person and
citation density. Write the paper in that register. Their sentences and their content are never
reused; they are exemplars of style, not sources.
TODO 4. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 5. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Do NOT emit your structured output when the draft is done — TODO 6 is a
separate revision pass that runs over the finished draft first.
TODO 6. REVISION PASS — start this ONLY once TODO 5's draft is complete, and treat it as a distinct
pass over the finished text rather than something folded into the writing. Read
`REVISION_CHECKLIST.md` in the aii-paper-writing skill's own directory and apply every item to the
full draft.

Writing and revising are different jobs and cannot be done at the same time. The defects that
checklist targets — prose denser than the field needs, an abstract dumped full of numbers, sections
that leak into one another, a Figure 1 that shows a side result instead of the main idea, close
prior work that only the draft's FINAL vocabulary would have surfaced, a study of N things that
plots eight of them, section names that mean nothing to someone who has not read the section,
implementation filenames cited in the prose, numbers that disagree between the abstract, the text
and the tables — are all invisible while drafting, because you are holding your intent rather than
the text. Every one is obvious to the first outside reader.

Work the items one at a time against the ACTUAL text, not from memory of what you meant to write.
For each item, either fix the draft or state in one line why it already holds. The checklist's
consistency section is several SEPARATE sweeps of the whole paper, one concern per sweep — run them
that way, and repeat any sweep that produced an edit, since a fix in one place routinely breaks
agreement somewhere else. Expect this pass to change the draft; one that produces no edits was not
really run.

Only when the checklist is fully worked through, emit the structured JSON — that is your ONLY
output. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate image/figure files at any point.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-07 07:01:32 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.
```

The agent loaded the **aii-paper-writing** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-paper-writing
description: "Writes the PROSE of an AI research paper: abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, discussion and conclusion, with a page budget, the 5-paragraph intro pattern, writing-quality rules, inline [FIGURE:fig_id] markers plus a structured figures array, and a MANDATORY REVISION_CHECKLIST.md pass over every finished draft. Use whenever a paper, abstract, section, or full write-up is being drafted or rewritten for a venue such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR or ACL. Triggers: write a paper, paper structure, abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, contributions, figure caption and placement, revision pass, academic prose. NOT for: assembling or compiling .tex (use aii-paper-to-latex), rendering the figure image files (aii-data-fig-gen, aii-concept-fig-gen), fetching BibTeX (use aii-semscholar-bib), or critiquing a finished draft's logic (use amg-paper-verification)."
---

## MANDATORY: the final revision pass

**`REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`, in this skill's own directory, MUST be read and
applied to every finished draft, always, as a separate pass after the writing
is done.** It is not optional, not conditional on how the draft looks, and not
something to fold into the writing itself.

Writing and revising are different jobs and cannot be done in one pass. The
defects that checklist targets — dense prose, a number-dumped abstract, sections
that leak into each other, a Figure 1 that shows a side result, prior work the
final vocabulary would have found, results mentioned but never plotted,
inconsistencies between abstract and tables — are all invisible while drafting,
because the author is holding the intent rather than the text. Every one of them
is obvious to the first outside reader. Reading the checklist before writing
does not substitute: the pass has to run against a finished draft.

So the order is always: write the complete draft → read `REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`
→ work its items against the full text, fixing as you go → only then emit the
output.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: "Fetches real BibTeX entries in one batch from Semantic Scholar by DOI, ArXiv ID or title via aii_semscholar_bib__fetch, normalises citation keys to AuthorYYYY, injects DOIs, and writes the result into references.bib, with a mandatory web-search fallback for anything not found. ALWAYS use whenever a bibliography, reference list or .bib file is being built or extended, and whenever a citation needs a verified entry instead of an invented one — never hand-write BibTeX first. Triggers: bibliography, references.bib, bibtex, citation key, DOI, arXiv id, Semantic Scholar, reference list, cite these papers, natbib entries. NOT for: writing the text around the citations (use aii-paper-writing), running bibtex and compiling (use aii-paper-to-latex), judging whether cited work supports the claims (use amg-paper-verification), or open-ended literature search and PDF mining (use aii-web-tools)."

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

<verification_results>
Your figures have consistency issues that need fixing:

ORPHAN FIGURES (in array but no matching marker in text):
  - Figure id='fig_wilcoxon_length_bins' in array but no [FIGURE:fig_wilcoxon_length_bins] marker in text

Summary: 4 unique markers in text, 5 figures in array.
</verification_results>

<task>
Fix ALL issues above. The rule is simple: every [FIGURE:id] marker in paper_text MUST have exactly one matching figure in the figures array, and every figure in the array MUST have a [FIGURE:id] marker in the text.

For orphan figures: either add [FIGURE:id] markers in the text for: fig_wilcoxon_length_bins, or remove them from the figures array if they are not needed.
</task>
```

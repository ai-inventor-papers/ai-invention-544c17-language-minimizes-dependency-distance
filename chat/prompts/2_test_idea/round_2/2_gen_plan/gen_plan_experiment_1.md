<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EXPERIMENT

EXPERIMENT
Run code to test hypotheses, implement methods, and collect empirical results.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any pip package), isolated workspace, gradual scaling (mini → full data).
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.
Skills: aii-json (schema validation), aii-openrouter-llms (call any LLM — GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.), domain-specific as needed.
Capabilities: Implement and run any code-based experiment, compare method vs baselines.
Deps: REQUIRED at least one DATASET | OPTIONAL RESEARCH for methodology guidance
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<time_budget>

The experiment executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_42Eo0dleXOQf/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_1`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_42Eo0dleXOQf/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_1/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_42Eo0dleXOQf/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_1/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_42Eo0dleXOQf/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_1/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Tail Index as a New DDM Statistic, Not Yet a Register Effect
hypothesis: >-
  Dependency distance minimization (DDM) is only partly captured by mean dependency distance (MDD): the Generalized Pareto
  peaks-over-threshold shape parameter ξ, fitted to sentence-length-normalized dependency lengths, is a statistically distinguishable,
  non-redundant descriptor of a treebank's dependency-length distribution -- it correlates with morphosyntactic typology (especially
  head-finality) more strongly than MDD does, and it generalizes across language families under leave-one-family-out cross-validation
  -- but on the current 18-treebank, 4-matched-pair evidence it does NOT yet establish a clean, reliably-signed spoken-lighter-tail
  effect: the model-comparison evidence for register improving fit over MDD is coefficient-level only (register p=0.0019,
  95% CI excludes 0) and NOT corroborated by the AICc/Akaike-weight comparison (ΔAICc=-0.052, weights 0.507/0.493, conventionally
  indistinguishable), the treebank-level spoken-vs-written direction tally is itself mixed and small-n (n=4 matched pairs:
  Slovenian, French, English, Turkish ATIS/IMST -- not 3), and the previously reported decile-level Wilcoxon 'paradox' (p=0.008,
  spoken > written in 64% of deciles) is a pseudo-replicated artifact of testing 209,982 non-independent arcs as if they were
  39 independent observations (true effect size r=-0.004, i.e. approximately null at the correct unit of analysis). The revised
  claim is therefore two-tiered: (a) CONFIRMED at level-3 phenomenological strength -- ξ is an orthogonal, typologically-informative,
  cross-family-generalizable new statistic for dependency-length distributions, distinct from and not reducible to MDD, with
  head-finality as its strongest known correlate (partial ρ=-0.55 vs MDD's -0.29); (b) NOT YET CONFIRMED -- whether spoken
  registers systematically minimize the tail more than written registers, which requires a properly-powered test at the pair
  or language level (not the arc level) and a larger set of matched register pairs before any directional register claim can
  be made. A necessary further test is whether ξ adds anything beyond a power-law/heavy-tail exponent already used in the
  Ferrer-i-Cancho line of dependency-length scaling work, since without that comparison the novelty of ξ over known heavy-tailedness
  measures is unestablished.
motivation: >-
  Sixty years of DDM research (Hawkins, Liu, Futrell, Temperley & Gildea, and the recent UD-wide functional/lexical split)
  has almost exclusively summarized dependency-length distributions by their mean or median, or tested full-distribution fits
  (power law vs. lognormal) against a null. None of this asks the question that memory-load theory actually predicts: working-memory
  failure is a threshold phenomenon (a dependency becomes unrecoverable once it exceeds some integration-cost budget), so
  the linguistically consequential quantity is how fast the probability of an extreme (rare, very long) dependency decays
  — exactly the object extreme value theory (EVT) was built to characterize in finance, hydrology, and reliability engineering,
  where the mean of a loss/flood/failure-time distribution is known to be a poor guide to catastrophic-tail behavior. If spoken
  language minimizes memory load harder than written language, that pressure should show up first and most cleanly as a lighter,
  more bounded tail (fewer syntactic 'shocks'), even in cases where mean DD looks similar because the bulk of short local
  dependencies dominates the mean. This reframes DDM from a central-tendency phenomenon to a risk-management phenomenon, giving
  quantitative typologists a new, theoretically motivated statistic (ξ) that is orthogonal to MDD and may explain family-level
  DDM anomalies that mean-based measures cannot.
assumptions:
- >-
  CoNLL-U dependency arcs and token linear order in UD treebanks are reliable enough (post length ≥ 500-sentence, LAS/UPOS
  quality filters) to compute dependency distances without treebank-specific annotation artifacts dominating the tail
- >-
  Sentence-length-normalized dependency distance (e.g., distance divided by sentence length, or distance conditioned on sentence-length
  quantile) is an adequate control for the mechanical fact that longer sentences permit longer arcs, so that a POT/GPD fit
  on the normalized variable targets genuine tail risk rather than a sentence-length artifact
- >-
  The 12 fully-spoken UD treebanks plus their written-register counterparts in the same language (where available, e.g. Slovenian
  SST vs. SSJ, French Rhapsodie/Spoken vs. GSD, English) provide enough tokens per treebank (≥ 20k dependency arcs) for a
  stable peaks-over-threshold tail fit
- >-
  Typological features (head-finality ratio, case system size, flexible word order) sourced from UD's own morphological features
  plus WALS/Grambank are accurate enough at the treebank level to serve as covariates in a mixed-effects model
- >-
  A treebank's tail index is a property of the language/register's production system and not purely an artifact of a single
  annotator's segmentation choices for coordination/apposition, which will be checked via a sensitivity analysis excluding
  flat/list-type relations
investigation_approach: >-
  Using HuggingFace's commul/universal_dependencies (all UD v2 treebanks), extract every token's dependency-to-head linear
  distance from CoNLL-U trees for every treebank meeting a minimum-size threshold, tag each treebank by register (fully-spoken
  vs. written vs. mixed, from the UD documentation and the LRE 2022 spoken-treebank survey) and by typological covariates.
  For each treebank compute (a) classical MDD/optimality-ratio baselines (permutation nulls, as in prior DDM work, for continuity
  with the literature) and (b) a peaks-over-threshold extreme value fit: choose a threshold via a mean-residual-life plot,
  fit a Generalized Pareto Distribution to sentence-length-normalized excess dependency lengths via maximum likelihood (scipy.stats.genpareto),
  and bootstrap confidence intervals on the shape parameter ξ. Fit a Bayesian/linear mixed-effects model with ξ (and separately
  MDD) as outcome, register (spoken/written) and typological features as fixed effects, and language family as a random effect,
  to test whether register predicts ξ after controlling for MDD, and vice versa — establishing whether the two statistics
  carry independent information. Use same-language spoken/written treebank pairs as a matched within-language design to isolate
  the register effect from cross-language typological confounds. Identify family/language outliers as treebanks whose ξ residual
  (after the typology-only model) exceeds a pre-registered threshold, and manually inspect a sample of their extreme-tail
  sentences for a syntactic explanation (e.g. extraposition, long-distance relative clauses, free-word-order scrambling).
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMS the hypothesis if: (1) within matched same-language spoken/written pairs, ξ is significantly lower (lighter tail,
  tighter upper bound) for spoken treebanks in a majority of pairs, even in pairs where MDD differences are small or non-significant;
  (2) the mixed-effects model shows register remains a significant predictor of ξ after controlling for MDD (i.e. ξ carries
  information MDD does not); (3) typological covariates (e.g. head-finality, case richness) explain a comparable or greater
  share of variance in ξ as they do in MDD, replicating known typology-DDM links but on a genuinely new axis. DISCONFIRMS
  / yields the phenomenological-anomaly finding instead if ξ is statistically indistinguishable from what MDD alone predicts
  (tail and center move together, no new information), or if spoken/written differences in ξ are inconsistent in direction
  across language pairs — in which case the paper reports ξ as a new descriptive typological statistic and characterizes which
  families deviate from the MDD-based expectation, satisfying the level-3 'surface and characterize a new empirical regularity'
  ambition even without full confirmation.
related_works:
- >-
  Futrell, Mahowald & Gibson (2015), 'Large-scale evidence of dependency length minimization': establishes DDM as a cross-language
  universal via mean dependency length against random baselines across ~37 languages; uses only central-tendency statistics,
  no tail/extreme-value analysis, and does not compare registers within a language.
- >-
  Temperley & Gildea (2018), 'Minimizing Syntactic Dependency Lengths: Typological/Psycholinguistic Evidence': the standard
  survey of DDM measures (MDD, optimality ratios, Hawkins' domain minimization); catalogs mean- and distribution-shape statistics
  (power-law/lognormal fits) but never a peaks-over-threshold/GPD tail-risk framing.
- >-
  'The Grammar Does the Work: Functional vs. Lexical Dependency Length Minimization Across Universal Dependencies' (2026,
  122 UD/SUD languages): the most recent and largest-scale UD-wide DDM study; splits dependencies into functional vs. lexical
  classes and uses MDD, Wilcoxon tests, and mixed-effects models with word-order/family covariates — confirmed via direct
  fetch to use no extreme value theory, survival analysis, or tail-index modeling, and to not compare spoken vs. written registers,
  leaving both gaps this hypothesis fills.
- >-
  Dobrovoljc (2022), 'Spoken Language Treebanks in Universal Dependencies: an Overview': surveys the 12 (of 228) fully-spoken
  UD treebanks and documents annotation-scheme heterogeneity for speech disfluencies — essential background for register coding
  and quality filtering, but a resource/survey paper, not a DDM study.
- >-
  Jiang & Liu (2015) and related spoken-vs-written Mandarin dependency-distance studies: compare mean dependency distance
  between speech and text in single languages using conventional MDD statistics; this hypothesis differs by (a) using the
  tail/shape statistic rather than the mean as the primary register discriminant, and (b) scaling the comparison across many
  UD languages/families with typology as an explicit covariate rather than a single-language case study.
inspiration: >-
  CONCEPTUAL: from finance and hydrology, the idea that a distribution's mean is a poor and sometimes misleading summary of
  risk, and that the object worth modeling is the tail — 'what does the worst 1% look like, and how fast does its probability
  decay' — reframes DDM's 'minimize load' claim as a claim about extreme-event suppression rather than average-case efficiency,
  which is a more direct read of the working-memory-failure mechanism DDM theory actually invokes. METHODOLOGICAL: the peaks-over-threshold
  / Generalized Pareto Distribution machinery from extreme value theory (mean-residual-life threshold selection, GPD shape-parameter
  MLE, POT bootstrap CIs), imported essentially as-is from its standard use in flood-frequency and operational-risk analysis,
  applied here to sentence-length-normalized dependency lengths in place of the power-law/lognormal whole-distribution fits
  or simple percentile cutoffs that quantitative typology currently uses. This stays close to methodology the field already
  trusts (mixed-effects models with family random effects, permutation-based null baselines, matched within-language register
  comparisons — all Dobrovoljc-familiar tools) while adding one genuinely new statistic (ξ) rather than a wholesale new framework.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance (DD)
  definition: >-
    For a word and its syntactic head in a dependency tree, the absolute difference in their linear positions in the sentence
    (number of words between them + 1); dependency length minimization (DLM/DDM) is the observed cross-linguistic tendency
    for actual sentences to have shorter total/mean dependency distance than random or alternative orderings of the same tree.
- term: Mean Dependency Distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The standard summary statistic in DDM research: the average dependency distance across all arcs in a sentence or corpus,
    typically compared to a permutation-generated random baseline via an 'optimality ratio'.
- term: Extreme Value Theory (EVT)
  definition: >-
    A branch of statistics dealing with the stochastic behavior of extreme deviations from the median of probability distributions,
    originally developed for engineering and environmental risk (e.g. flood levels, material failure) where average behavior
    is uninformative about rare catastrophic events.
- term: Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT)
  definition: >-
    An EVT method that models all observations exceeding a sufficiently high threshold, rather than only block maxima, using
    the Generalized Pareto Distribution — more data-efficient than block-maxima EVT and standard practice for tail modeling
    of moderate-sized empirical samples.
- term: Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) shape parameter ξ
  definition: >-
    The parameter governing the tail's heaviness in a POT fit: ξ > 0 means an unbounded, heavy (power-law-like) tail; ξ =
    0 means an exponentially-decaying tail; ξ < 0 means a bounded tail with a hard upper limit. Used here as the 'tail risk'
    statistic for dependency lengths, analogous to its use for insurance losses or extreme rainfall.
- term: Head-finality / typological covariates
  definition: >-
    Morphosyntactic properties of a language extracted from UD morphological annotations and typological databases (WALS/Grambank):
    whether heads systematically follow their dependents (OV-type order), the size/productivity of the case-marking system,
    and the degree of word-order flexibility — all previously linked to MDD and hypothesized here to also predict tail shape.
summary: >-
  Instead of measuring dependency-length minimization by its mean (as all prior UD-wide studies do), this hypothesis applies
  extreme-value peaks-over-threshold statistics to fit a tail-risk shape parameter to dependency-length distributions across
  UD treebanks, testing whether spoken language and typologically 'harder' languages minimize catastrophic long-distance dependencies
  specifically, in a way plain mean-distance measures miss or contradict.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same EVT frame; register claim narrowed to unresolved after pseudo-replication and weak AICc evidence
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Corrected n=3 to n=4 matched spoken/written pairs (Turkish ATIS/IMST was in the evaluation but omitted from the paper's
  stated sample)
- >-
  Retracted the decile-level Wilcoxon 'register asymmetry / paradox' as a headline finding: effect size r=-0.004 reveals it
  was pseudo-replicated over 209,982 non-independent arcs treated as 39 independent deciles; true effect at the correct unit
  of analysis is near-null
- >-
  Downgraded the model-comparison evidence for register's independent contribution from 'mixed-effects models favor register'
  (AICc-based, in fact ambiguous: ΔAICc=-0.052, weights ~tied) to 'coefficient-level evidence only' (p=0.0019, CI excludes
  0), and flagged that the 'mixed-effects' models are effectively fixed-effects since family variance is ~0
- >-
  Split the hypothesis into two explicit tiers: (a) ξ as a novel, non-redundant, typologically-generalizable statistic --
  well-supported and retained as the primary contribution; (b) a directional spoken-vs-written tail effect -- now explicitly
  unresolved, pending a properly-powered pair/language-level test rather than an arc-level one
- >-
  Added a required comparison against power-law/heavy-tail exponent baselines from the Ferrer-i-Cancho dependency-length scaling
  literature, since the paper as reviewed never engaged this competing account of 'how heavy is the tail'
- >-
  Flagged that small treebanks (e.g. 20-sentence Nigerian Pidgin) should not enter primary GPD tail estimates; a minimum-arc-count
  subset should be the primary analysis with the full sample as a robustness check

id: experiment_iter2_dir2
type: experiment
objective: >-
  Compute power-law tail exponents α for all 18 UD treebanks using the same sentence-length-normalized dependency distances
  already extracted in iteration 1; estimate both α (via MLE, following Clauset et al. / Ferrer-i-Cancho methods) and ξ (from
  prior iteration); directly compare their predictive power for register, head-finality, and other typological features, quantifying
  whether ξ or α better predicts these linguistic variables and whether both contribute independent information.
approach: >-
  Load the full_data_out.json from the iteration 1 dataset artifact. For each of the 18 treebanks: (1) Extract all normalized
  dependency distances (from iter 1 output); (2) Choose a threshold using mean residual life (MRL) plot, consistent with prior
  EVT literature (e.g., 75th or 80th percentile); (3) Fit a power-law exponent α to exceedances above the threshold via maximum-likelihood
  estimation using standard complex-systems tools (scipy.optimize.minimize or similar, implementing the standard MLE formula
  for power-law tail exponent); (4) Bootstrap confidence intervals on α. (5) Compile a treebank-level table with ξ (from iter
  1), α (new), and both their 95% CIs. (6) Compute Spearman rank correlations: ξ vs. register, α vs. register; ξ vs. head-finality
  (empirical), α vs. head-finality; ξ vs. case richness, α vs. case richness; ξ vs. word-order flexibility, α vs. word-order
  flexibility. Apply Holm-Bonferroni correction over the 10 tests. (7) Fit mixed-effects models: register ~ ξ, register ~
  α, register ~ ξ + α (to test whether both contribute). Compute R² marginal, AICc, and Akaike weights to compare model fit.
  (8) Report whether ξ and α are correlated (Spearman ρ), suggesting they measure the same thing vs. independent (suggesting
  both carry information). Output method_out.json with: treebank-level ξ and α estimates with CIs, correlation matrix (ξ vs.
  α vs. register vs. typology features), mixed-effects model comparison tables, effect sizes, and a summary conclusion on
  novelty (does ξ predict better than α? do both contribute?). Sensitivity analysis: compare results at 75th vs. 80th vs.
  90th percentile thresholds for both ξ and α to ensure robustness.

title: UD Dependency Distances by Register and Typology
summary: >-
  full_data_out.json (schema exp_sel_data_out, 33,030 examples, 58MB) holds one 'ud_treebanks' group built from 18 Universal
  Dependencies v2.18 treebanks (universal-dependencies/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace, alias commul/universal_dependencies),
  evenly subsampled to <=2000 sentences per treebank to stay under the 100MB limit while preserving document-order representativeness
  (full unsampled treebanks remain in temp/datasets/ for re-extraction). Coverage includes three matched spoken/written register
  pairs in the same language (Slovenian SST[spoken]/SSJ[written], French Rhapsodie[spoken]/GSD[written], English ESLSpok[spoken]/EWT[written]/GUM[mixed])
  plus nine typologically diverse written/mixed treebanks (Turkish ATIS[spoken, task-oriented]/IMST[written], Arabic PADT,
  Japanese GSD, Korean GSD, Hindi HDTB, Finnish TDT, Chinese GSD, Russian SynTagRus, Nigerian Pidgin NSC, Neapolitan RB) spanning
  head-initial/head-final word orders, case-rich/case-poor morphology, and multiple language families (Indo-European, Turkic,
  Afro-Asiatic, Japonic, Koreanic, Uralic, Sino-Tibetan, Creole). Each example is one CoNLL-U sentence: `input` is a JSON
  string with treebank_id, surface text, tokens, and UPOS tags; `output` is a JSON string with per-arc dependency_distances
  (|dependent_position - head_position|, 1-indexed, artificial ROOT.0 arc excluded), sentence-length-normalized_distances,
  heads, and deprels -- everything needed for peaks-over-threshold / extreme-value analysis of Dependency Distance Minimization
  (DDM). Flat metadata_* fields carry treebank_id, language, ISO 639-3 code, language family, register (spoken/written/mixed),
  sentence_id, row_index, sentence_length, num_arcs, mean dependency distance, mean normalized distance, and head_finality_ratio
  (fraction of arcs where head follows dependent) -- all computed directly from the CoNLL-U head column, no external library
  dependency. 27,012 of the 33,030 examples (10 of 18 covered languages) additionally carry metadata_grambank_features: a
  JSON string of a 15-feature core morphosyntax subset (case/agreement/word-order-adjacent WALS-style features) from Grambank
  v1.0.3 (Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7740139, CLDF format, 2,467 languages x 195 features), joined by language name since Grambank
  is language-level, not treebank-level -- both registers of the same language deliberately share identical typology values
  (the within-language matched design the artifact plan calls for). Languages without a Grambank match get metadata_grambank_features=null
  rather than an imputed value. Downstream experiment code should: (1) group by metadata_language + metadata_register to compare

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.

# Computational linguistics — field handbook

## Overview

Scope: computational linguistics as a SCIENCE of language — what models reveal about language and
about human language processing, and how such claims are measured. NLP engineering (training,
prompting, retrieval, agents) is out of scope. The star is the SUBSTRATE below: a dated,
source-anchored map with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only IDEATION lens is open questions;
a thin execution floor follows it.

**How to use this map.** It is a STARTING POINT, not a substitute for looking. Its crowded
list is necessarily incomplete and its frontier is dated; map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
never *open*. Before committing to any direction, run your own fresh, dated saturation search
on that specific direction and confirm it is actually unoccupied. Treat the sections below as
material to reason against — the questions especially — rather than as conclusions to accept.

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)

- **The measurement instrument is itself under audit.** A 445-benchmark, 29-reviewer systematic review found "patterns
  related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the
  resulting claims" [S2] — a capability claim is judged on its construct, not just its number.
- **Output is not competence.** "LLMs' metalinguistic judgments are inferior to quantities directly
  derived from representations" [S3]; grammaticality separates in hidden states where string
  probability does not [S12].
- **A negative result about a model is a claim about your probe:** "negative results relying on
  metalinguistic prompts cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that an LLM lacks a particular
  linguistic generalization" [S3].
- **Disagreement is data.** Human label variation "reflects the diversity of human perspectives
  rather than mere error"; collapsing it manufactures "artificial consensus" [S7].
- **Explanatory status is graded, and the grades are named.** LLMs supply "how-possibly
  explanations (HPEs)" about acquisition and competence, while "current LLMs do not yet satisfy"
  the requirements for how-actually explanations [S4].
- **Theory bounds the empirics** — expressivity results explain "why current transformer
  architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms" [S24] — but they are
  assumption-relative by construction [S11].

## Frontier (recency-weighted)

**Measurement & construct validity** *(weight-capped — the loudest thread)*

- A systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks by 29 expert reviewers found validity-undermining
  patterns across measured phenomena, tasks and scoring metrics [S2] (NeurIPS 2025).
- The JUDGe 2026 workshop frames judge validity as a systems property: "Evaluation validity is not a property of
  a judge in isolation" [S25] (2026). Peer-reviewed baseline beneath it: reliability varies by
  property, judge expertise, and whether text is human- or model-generated [S21] (ACL 2025).
- Contamination has its own position paper, which sets out to "highlight the wide prevalence of
  benchmark dataset contamination and outline the properties of contamination-resistant datasets"
  [S14] (ICML 2026 Position Track).

**What LMs represent vs what they output**

- A grammaticality probe "outperforms LM probability-based grammaticality judgments" — yet
  on semantic plausibility "the probe however performs worse than string probability" [S12] (2026-05).
- ACL 2026's Best Paper found a directional semantic failure: a "pervasive Teleological Bias" where
  models "hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, even overriding explicit textual
  cancellation"; prompting interventions "partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration
  crisis" [S8] (2026).

**Cognitive modelling and the scale paradox**

- Surprisal's fit to reading times peaks near two billion training tokens, after which perplexity
  gains produce "poorer fits to human reading times" [S16] (Findings of EMNLP 2023).
- Not an artifact of latency measures — the inverse relation "still obtains" on two fMRI datasets
  across 17 LMs [S17] (EACL 2026).
- The predictor is unstable: early-layer representations beat surprisal on early-pass eye movements,
  and "the best-performing predictor varies strongly depending on the language and eye-tracking
  measure" [S23] (ACL 2026).

**The resource map and language varieties**

- Catalogue counts mislead: 59% of the surveyed languages score zero catalogued-dataset density, yet literature mining shows active dataset production for many [S5] (2026-05).
- The dominant multilingual benchmark is criticized at protocol level — many translations "fall below
  the claimed 90% quality standard", and "copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU
  scores" [S13] (EMNLP 2025).

**Annotation, disagreement, pluralism**

- The perspectivist turn has its own survey, mapping "a shift from consensus learning toward
  explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among
  annotators" [S6] (2026-01).

**Meta-science of the field**

- Submission volume outran reviewing capacity — 17,087 submissions against 1,424 area chairs,
  with the community weighing "options for limiting submissions for the first time in ACL's
  history" [S1] (2026-05) — yet measured review quality shows "no consistent decline in median
  review quality across venues and years" [S22] (2026-01). ACL 2026's special theme was model
  explainability [S10].

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed) · Durable core

- Durable and still load-bearing: surprisal theory as the LM-to-processing-cost bridge [S16];
  minimal-pair evaluation as the standard syntactic instrument [S12]; direct probability
  measurement as the stronger read-out of linguistic knowledge [S3]; the child-learning data
  bound — "less than 100 million words" — with curriculum learning, heavily attempted,
  "largely unsuccessful" [S18].
- The three standing stances on LLMs and linguistic theory [S4]: **insulationism** (LLMs are
  irrelevant to human language), **eliminativism** (they can replace traditional linguistic
  theories), **conciliationism** (they are useful tools for linguistic research).

## ⛔ Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)

The blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:

- **Creating another multilingual / low-resource benchmark.** Dense and institutionalized: the
  FLORES+ family plus its published protocol critique [S13], variety-level suites [S19], and
  and a 232-paper survey of the multilingual/edge pipeline [S20].
- **Benchmark-contamination detection.** Saturated; the prevalence of contamination and the
  properties of resistant datasets are already laid out in a peer-reviewed position paper [S14].
- **LLM-as-judge meta-evaluation and bias catalogues.** A 20-dataset / 11-model peer-reviewed study
  [S21] plus a dedicated 2026 workshop [S25] own this.
- **Minimal-pair grammaticality evaluation and its representation-level follow-up.** Models already
  "discriminate well between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in tightly controlled minimal
  pairs", and the probe-vs-probability comparison is published [S12].
- **Human label variation / perspectivist modelling.** Mapped end-to-end by its own survey [S6] and
  already escalated into post-training [S7].
- **Computational morphology and low-resource dependency parsing.** Both have their own survey and
  a 2026 cross-architecture evaluation [S29] [S30].
- **Computational sociolinguistics / dialect NLP.** Mapped by its own survey [S27], with a
  variety-level benchmark already published [S19].
- **Sign-language processing tooling and reproducibility.** The ad-hoc-code problem and a framework
  answer to it are published [S28].
- **Language-documentation annotation tooling.** 98 tools already surveyed against documentary
  requirements [S26].
- **Coreference and discourse resolution.** A shared-task series in its fifth edition, with a 2026
  benchmark wave alongside it [S31].
- **Diachronic / lexical semantic change.** Mature enough that its canonical benchmark is itself
  under published critique, with a dedicated workshop series [S32].
- **Surprisal-vs-reading-time psychometrics.** The inverse-scaling result, its tipping point, its
  fMRI generalization, and its layerwise refinement are all published [S16] [S17] [S23].

> **Standing directive — this list is necessarily INCOMPLETE.** Map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
> NOT *open*. Before committing to any direction this map does not explicitly flag as crowded, run a
> fresh, dated saturation search and confirm the space is actually unoccupied. (Measured in this forge's own
> A/B runs: a live-searching baseline beats a static handbook precisely on the crowded lanes a map omits.)

## Open questions the field hasn't answered

*(the whole lens — the reader answers in their own way)*

1. Prompted output underestimates linguistic knowledge [S3], and grammaticality separates in hidden
   states where string probability does not [S12]. **Is the observable this field treats as its
   measurement — model output, or string probability — even the right object for a claim about
   linguistic competence?** Instruments changed without this being settled.
2. If a review of 445 benchmarks finds validity-undermining patterns [S2] while judge validity is a
   property of a whole pipeline rather than a judge [S25], what would a capability claim here have
   to report before it should be believed?
3. LLMs supply how-possibly but not how-actually explanations of language [S4]. What evidence would
   move a computational result across that line, and does any current design even address it?
4. The best cognitive predictor is a deliberately undertrained model [S16] [S17], while the strongest
   predictor varies by layer, language, and measure [S23]. What is being modelled when psychometric
   fit and language-modelling quality pull in opposite directions?
5. Catalogue counts and literature evidence disagree about which languages are resourced [S5], and
   the dominant benchmark is protocol-flawed for exactly those languages [S13]. Is "low-resource" a
   property of languages, of documentation infrastructure, or of evaluation design?
6. Submission volume outran reviewing capacity to the point of considering caps [S1], yet measured
   review quality has not declined [S22]. If the bottleneck is not quality, what is the constraint
   actually selecting for in what gets published?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Add a benchmark, a language, or a model to an existing evaluation and report the numbers. | *Computational Linguistics* prints the bar for a **squib**: "unexpectedness, as for example a demonstration that a commonly accepted idea or method is flawed", or "genuine novelty, as for example thus-far unnoticed language data that challenges current methods". Not "more coverage". | problematizes-nothing — coverage counts only if it breaks something | A | [S9] |
| Probe an LLM on a linguistic phenomenon and report accuracy. | The ACL 2026 **Best Paper** derived a diagnostic from linguistic theory, found a *systematic directional* failure — models "systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events" — and showed prompting fixes "partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration crisis". Theory-derived contrast plus a failure with a shape. | problematizes-nothing — an accuracy number on a new phenomenon is coverage | L | [S8] |
| Conclude from failed metalinguistic prompts that a model lacks a linguistic generalization. | **Buried (EMNLP 2023):** metalinguistic judgments are inferior to direct probability read-outs, and "consistency gets worse as the prompt query diverges from direct measurements of next-word probabilities". Reopening condition: the same negative result reproduced against direct probability measurement. | wrong-result — you measured the probe, not the model | L | [S3] |

> **Science-vs-application, as this field draws it:** the journal asks for a "substantive
> contribution to the computational processing of language" and clear unexpectedness, genuine
> novelty, or broad relevance [S9]. A working system with a headline number and no overturned
> assumption is application-tier — hence the separate resource, demo, and social-impact award
> tracks rather than one axis [S15].

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Test linguistic knowledge by prompting the model to judge. | Designing the probe: read probabilities directly where possible; report prompting as a second, weaker measurement — never as sole evidence for absence. | wrong-result — negative results are unsound from prompts alone | L | [S3] |
| Report benchmark accuracy as a capability claim. | Writing the claim: define the construct, say how items operationalize it, and report uncertainty. | wrong-result — the score does not measure the named phenomenon | L | [S2] |
| Use FLORES+ as ground truth for low-resource MT quality. | Choosing the eval set: check quality and domain fit for your languages and add a naturalistic set — models strong on one can look weak on the other. | wrong-result — the benchmark's own quality bound caps your conclusion | L | [S13] |
| Aggregate annotations to a majority label by default. | Handling annotation: decide explicitly whether disagreement is error or signal for THIS task; preserve the distribution when it is signal. | wrong-result — artificial consensus erases the phenomenon | L | [S7] [S6] |
| Reach for a pretrained transformer parser on a low-resource language. | Choosing the architecture: below the data crossover a Biaffine LSTM beats transformers, and morphological complexity widens that disadvantage. | wasted-cost — the bigger model is the weaker one in that regime | L | [S30] |
| Call a language low-resource from catalogue counts. | Scoping resources: check literature-level dataset circulation, not just registered catalogues, before claiming a data gap. | wrong-result — the gap may be documentation, not data | L | [S5] |
| Argue cognitive plausibility from a bigger, better LM. | Making a processing claim: treat training data and model scale as deliberate variables and report layer and measure — the best predictor changes with both. | wrong-result — the inverse relation holds on latency and fMRI alike [S17]; fit peaks near 2B training tokens [S16] | L | [S16] [S17] [S23] |

## Decision guide

- **Competence vs performance:** for "does the model know X", read probabilities or probe
  representations [S3] [S12]; for "does it use X when generating", behavioral output is right —
  do not swap them.
- **Cognitive-modelling target:** latency and fMRI now agree on inverse scaling [S16] [S17]; early-
  vs late-pass measures disagree on the best predictor [S23] — name the measure before the model.
- **Aggregating annotations:** aggregate when the task has a defensible single answer; preserve the
  distribution when variation is interpretive [S6] [S7].
- **Placing yourself in the theory debate:** the field names three positions — insulationist,
  eliminativist, conciliationist [S4]; a paper implies one whether or not it says so.

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)

- Surprisal = negative log probability of a word in context; the standard LM-to-processing-cost link [S16].
- Minimal pairs = near-identical sentences differing in acceptability; BLiMP-style suites are the
  canonical syntactic instrument [S12].
- Human label variation (HLV) = legitimate annotator disagreement, distinct from annotation error [S7].
- Construct validity = whether a measure represents the phenomenon it names; now a routine reviewer
  question in this field [S2].

## Reference documentation

- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — dated frontier numbers, lane-occupancy flags, and per-source
  review status. Re-check this FIRST before any novelty verdict or write-up.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)

- ⚠️ **No peer-reviewed 2026 synthesis of "what computational linguistics is now" was recoverable
  this pass.** A Philosophy Compass survey of the philosophy of language models exists but was
  paywalled; the field-identity framing rests on one preprint [S4] plus venue artifacts [S9] [S10].
  Confirm before asserting a field-wide consensus in a write-up.
- ⚠️ **The ACL 2026 award slate could not be read with committee rationale** — the page lists titles
  only, so the taste row rests on the paper's own abstract [S8] plus the journal's printed criteria
  [S9], not a meta-review. Confirm/refute: an award rationale or area-chair commentary for ACL 2026.

<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviewer (Step 2.2: REVIEW_HYPO)

Pipeline: GEN_HYPO → REVIEW_HYPO (you) → INVENTION_LOOP → GEN_PAPER_REPO

You review a hypothesis BEFORE any experiments run. Catch problems early.

Rigorous pre-flight check → saves compute. Rubber-stamping → wasted pipeline run.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

ROLE: You are a very experienced and critical conference reviewer.
Your expertise spans the domain of the hypothesis under review.
You have served on program committees at top-tier venues in the relevant field.

TASK: Perform a deep and honest review (at the level of a top-tier venue submission) of
this research hypothesis BEFORE any experiments have been run.

GOAL: Your review feeds directly back to the hypothesis author. The objective is to
maximize the overall review score in subsequent rounds. Every piece of feedback you
give should be written with this goal in mind — prioritize the critiques and suggestions
that would produce the largest score improvement if addressed. Don't waste the author's
iteration budget on low-impact polish when there are score-blocking issues to fix.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES: Provide a thorough assessment touching on each of these:
(a) Originality: Are the ideas new? Novel combination of known techniques? Clear
    differentiation from prior work? Is related work adequately cited?
(b) Quality: Is the proposal technically sound? Are claims well supported? Is the
    methodology appropriate? Are the authors honest about limitations?
(c) Clarity: Is the hypothesis clearly written and well organized? Does it provide
    enough information for an expert to understand and evaluate it?
(d) Significance: Are the expected results important? Would others build on this?
    Does it address a meaningful problem better than prior work?

SUPPLEMENTARY SCORES: Rate each on a 1-4 scale.
Soundness (1-4) — soundness of the technical claims and proposed methodology:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Presentation (1-4) — quality of writing, clarity, and contextualization relative to prior work:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Contribution (1-4) — quality of the overall contribution, importance of questions asked,
originality of ideas, value to the broader research community:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor

OVERALL SCORE (1-10):
  10 — Award quality: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on one or more
       areas of the field, with exceptionally strong evaluation, reproducibility,
       and resources, and no unaddressed concerns.
   9 — Very Strong Accept: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on at least
       one area and excellent impact on multiple areas, with flawless evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   8 — Strong Accept: Technically strong with novel ideas, excellent impact on at least
       one area or high-to-excellent impact on multiple areas, with excellent evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   7 — Accept: Technically solid, with high impact on at least one sub-area or
       moderate-to-high impact on more than one area, with good-to-excellent evaluation,
       resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   6 — Weak Accept: Technically solid, moderate-to-high impact, with no major concerns
       with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility.
   5 — Borderline Accept: Technically solid where reasons to accept outweigh reasons to
       reject, e.g., limited evaluation. Use sparingly.
   4 — Borderline Reject: Technically solid where reasons to reject, e.g., limited
       evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept. Use sparingly.
   3 — Reject: For instance, technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility.
   2 — Strong Reject: For instance, major technical flaws, poor evaluation, limited
       impact, poor reproducibility.
   1 — Very Strong Reject: For instance, trivial results or unaddressed concerns.

CONFIDENCE (1-5):
  5: Absolutely certain. Very familiar with related work, checked details carefully.
  4: Confident but not absolutely certain. Unlikely you misunderstood something.
  3: Fairly confident. Possible you missed some related work or details.
  2: Willing to defend your assessment, but quite likely missed central aspects.
  1: Educated guess. Not in your area or difficult to evaluate.

For each dimension, provide a list of specific improvements:
- WHAT needs to change
- HOW to change it (concrete enough for the author to act on immediately)
- EXPECTED SCORE IMPACT: how much would fixing this raise the overall score?

REVIEW PRINCIPLES:
- Be specific and actionable — vague critique is useless
- Ground your review in evidence — search for existing work, accepted papers, known results
- Rank critiques by score impact — address the biggest score blockers first
- Distinguish major issues (would waste compute if not fixed) from minor issues (polish)
- Acknowledge genuine strengths — don't be negative for its own sake
- Compare against the bar set by accepted papers at top-tier venues
- Flag fatal flaws that would make experiments pointless if not addressed first
- Screen the hypothesis for prior art before any compute is spent. Search the web for the proposed idea, its method name, and its central claim. If the idea already exists, say so and name the source — this is the cheapest point in the pipeline to catch it
- Distinguish a genuinely new idea from a restatement of known work in new vocabulary. Coining a term for an existing method is not originality, and should be scored as a major issue
- Judge ambition against what the request left OPEN. The less the request constrained, the more of that space the hypothesis was expected to claim; a safe, small study in answer to a wide-open question is a major issue, not a minor one
- Reject measurement dressed as contribution: an established measure, instrument or method applied to more cases — more models, languages, periods, countries, corpora or settings — is a table, not a finding. Say so plainly and ask for a claim that would change what someone in the field does or believes
- Ask whether the hypothesis is POSITIVE BY DESIGN — is there a mechanism that predicts the effect, or is the outcome a coin flip? If the direction is genuinely unknown, require that both outcomes be informative, or the run risks ending with an uninformative negative result

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Language Minimizes Dependency-Distance Tail Risk
hypothesis: >-
  Dependency distance minimization (DDM) across languages operates predominantly on the upper tail of the dependency-length
  distribution rather than on its central tendency: registers, typologies, and families that look similar in mean dependency
  distance (MDD) will differ systematically in the extreme-value tail index (the Generalized Pareto shape parameter ξ fitted
  to sentence-length-normalized dependency lengths above a high threshold via peaks-over-threshold), and this tail index —
  not MDD — is the statistic that best separates spoken from written registers and best tracks morphosyntactic typology (head-finality,
  case-marking richness, free word order).
motivation: >-
  Sixty years of DDM research (Hawkins, Liu, Futrell, Temperley & Gildea, and the recent UD-wide functional/lexical split)
  has almost exclusively summarized dependency-length distributions by their mean or median, or tested full-distribution fits
  (power law vs. lognormal) against a null. None of this asks the question that memory-load theory actually predicts: working-memory
  failure is a threshold phenomenon (a dependency becomes unrecoverable once it exceeds some integration-cost budget), so
  the linguistically consequential quantity is how fast the probability of an extreme (rare, very long) dependency decays
  — exactly the object extreme value theory (EVT) was built to characterize in finance, hydrology, and reliability engineering,
  where the mean of a loss/flood/failure-time distribution is known to be a poor guide to catastrophic-tail behavior. If spoken
  language minimizes memory load harder than written language, that pressure should show up first and most cleanly as a lighter,
  more bounded tail (fewer syntactic 'shocks'), even in cases where mean DD looks similar because the bulk of short local
  dependencies dominates the mean. This reframes DDM from a central-tendency phenomenon to a risk-management phenomenon, giving
  quantitative typologists a new, theoretically motivated statistic (ξ) that is orthogonal to MDD and may explain family-level
  DDM anomalies that mean-based measures cannot.
assumptions:
- >-
  CoNLL-U dependency arcs and token linear order in UD treebanks are reliable enough (post length ≥ 500-sentence, LAS/UPOS
  quality filters) to compute dependency distances without treebank-specific annotation artifacts dominating the tail
- >-
  Sentence-length-normalized dependency distance (e.g., distance divided by sentence length, or distance conditioned on sentence-length
  quantile) is an adequate control for the mechanical fact that longer sentences permit longer arcs, so that a POT/GPD fit
  on the normalized variable targets genuine tail risk rather than a sentence-length artifact
- >-
  The 12 fully-spoken UD treebanks plus their written-register counterparts in the same language (where available, e.g. Slovenian
  SST vs. SSJ, French Rhapsodie/Spoken vs. GSD, English) provide enough tokens per treebank (≥ 20k dependency arcs) for a
  stable peaks-over-threshold tail fit
- >-
  Typological features (head-finality ratio, case system size, flexible word order) sourced from UD's own morphological features
  plus WALS/Grambank are accurate enough at the treebank level to serve as covariates in a mixed-effects model
- >-
  A treebank's tail index is a property of the language/register's production system and not purely an artifact of a single
  annotator's segmentation choices for coordination/apposition, which will be checked via a sensitivity analysis excluding
  flat/list-type relations
investigation_approach: >-
  Using HuggingFace's commul/universal_dependencies (all UD v2 treebanks), extract every token's dependency-to-head linear
  distance from CoNLL-U trees for every treebank meeting a minimum-size threshold, tag each treebank by register (fully-spoken
  vs. written vs. mixed, from the UD documentation and the LRE 2022 spoken-treebank survey) and by typological covariates.
  For each treebank compute (a) classical MDD/optimality-ratio baselines (permutation nulls, as in prior DDM work, for continuity
  with the literature) and (b) a peaks-over-threshold extreme value fit: choose a threshold via a mean-residual-life plot,
  fit a Generalized Pareto Distribution to sentence-length-normalized excess dependency lengths via maximum likelihood (scipy.stats.genpareto),
  and bootstrap confidence intervals on the shape parameter ξ. Fit a Bayesian/linear mixed-effects model with ξ (and separately
  MDD) as outcome, register (spoken/written) and typological features as fixed effects, and language family as a random effect,
  to test whether register predicts ξ after controlling for MDD, and vice versa — establishing whether the two statistics
  carry independent information. Use same-language spoken/written treebank pairs as a matched within-language design to isolate
  the register effect from cross-language typological confounds. Identify family/language outliers as treebanks whose ξ residual
  (after the typology-only model) exceeds a pre-registered threshold, and manually inspect a sample of their extreme-tail
  sentences for a syntactic explanation (e.g. extraposition, long-distance relative clauses, free-word-order scrambling).
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMS the hypothesis if: (1) within matched same-language spoken/written pairs, ξ is significantly lower (lighter tail,
  tighter upper bound) for spoken treebanks in a majority of pairs, even in pairs where MDD differences are small or non-significant;
  (2) the mixed-effects model shows register remains a significant predictor of ξ after controlling for MDD (i.e. ξ carries
  information MDD does not); (3) typological covariates (e.g. head-finality, case richness) explain a comparable or greater
  share of variance in ξ as they do in MDD, replicating known typology-DDM links but on a genuinely new axis. DISCONFIRMS
  / yields the phenomenological-anomaly finding instead if ξ is statistically indistinguishable from what MDD alone predicts
  (tail and center move together, no new information), or if spoken/written differences in ξ are inconsistent in direction
  across language pairs — in which case the paper reports ξ as a new descriptive typological statistic and characterizes which
  families deviate from the MDD-based expectation, satisfying the level-3 'surface and characterize a new empirical regularity'
  ambition even without full confirmation.
related_works:
- >-
  Futrell, Mahowald & Gibson (2015), 'Large-scale evidence of dependency length minimization': establishes DDM as a cross-language
  universal via mean dependency length against random baselines across ~37 languages; uses only central-tendency statistics,
  no tail/extreme-value analysis, and does not compare registers within a language.
- >-
  Temperley & Gildea (2018), 'Minimizing Syntactic Dependency Lengths: Typological/Psycholinguistic Evidence': the standard
  survey of DDM measures (MDD, optimality ratios, Hawkins' domain minimization); catalogs mean- and distribution-shape statistics
  (power-law/lognormal fits) but never a peaks-over-threshold/GPD tail-risk framing.
- >-
  'The Grammar Does the Work: Functional vs. Lexical Dependency Length Minimization Across Universal Dependencies' (2026,
  122 UD/SUD languages): the most recent and largest-scale UD-wide DDM study; splits dependencies into functional vs. lexical
  classes and uses MDD, Wilcoxon tests, and mixed-effects models with word-order/family covariates — confirmed via direct
  fetch to use no extreme value theory, survival analysis, or tail-index modeling, and to not compare spoken vs. written registers,
  leaving both gaps this hypothesis fills.
- >-
  Dobrovoljc (2022), 'Spoken Language Treebanks in Universal Dependencies: an Overview': surveys the 12 (of 228) fully-spoken
  UD treebanks and documents annotation-scheme heterogeneity for speech disfluencies — essential background for register coding
  and quality filtering, but a resource/survey paper, not a DDM study.
- >-
  Jiang & Liu (2015) and related spoken-vs-written Mandarin dependency-distance studies: compare mean dependency distance
  between speech and text in single languages using conventional MDD statistics; this hypothesis differs by (a) using the
  tail/shape statistic rather than the mean as the primary register discriminant, and (b) scaling the comparison across many
  UD languages/families with typology as an explicit covariate rather than a single-language case study.
inspiration: >-
  CONCEPTUAL: from finance and hydrology, the idea that a distribution's mean is a poor and sometimes misleading summary of
  risk, and that the object worth modeling is the tail — 'what does the worst 1% look like, and how fast does its probability
  decay' — reframes DDM's 'minimize load' claim as a claim about extreme-event suppression rather than average-case efficiency,
  which is a more direct read of the working-memory-failure mechanism DDM theory actually invokes. METHODOLOGICAL: the peaks-over-threshold
  / Generalized Pareto Distribution machinery from extreme value theory (mean-residual-life threshold selection, GPD shape-parameter
  MLE, POT bootstrap CIs), imported essentially as-is from its standard use in flood-frequency and operational-risk analysis,
  applied here to sentence-length-normalized dependency lengths in place of the power-law/lognormal whole-distribution fits
  or simple percentile cutoffs that quantitative typology currently uses. This stays close to methodology the field already
  trusts (mixed-effects models with family random effects, permutation-based null baselines, matched within-language register
  comparisons — all Dobrovoljc-familiar tools) while adding one genuinely new statistic (ξ) rather than a wholesale new framework.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance (DD)
  definition: >-
    For a word and its syntactic head in a dependency tree, the absolute difference in their linear positions in the sentence
    (number of words between them + 1); dependency length minimization (DLM/DDM) is the observed cross-linguistic tendency
    for actual sentences to have shorter total/mean dependency distance than random or alternative orderings of the same tree.
- term: Mean Dependency Distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The standard summary statistic in DDM research: the average dependency distance across all arcs in a sentence or corpus,
    typically compared to a permutation-generated random baseline via an 'optimality ratio'.
- term: Extreme Value Theory (EVT)
  definition: >-
    A branch of statistics dealing with the stochastic behavior of extreme deviations from the median of probability distributions,
    originally developed for engineering and environmental risk (e.g. flood levels, material failure) where average behavior
    is uninformative about rare catastrophic events.
- term: Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT)
  definition: >-
    An EVT method that models all observations exceeding a sufficiently high threshold, rather than only block maxima, using
    the Generalized Pareto Distribution — more data-efficient than block-maxima EVT and standard practice for tail modeling
    of moderate-sized empirical samples.
- term: Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) shape parameter ξ
  definition: >-
    The parameter governing the tail's heaviness in a POT fit: ξ > 0 means an unbounded, heavy (power-law-like) tail; ξ =
    0 means an exponentially-decaying tail; ξ < 0 means a bounded tail with a hard upper limit. Used here as the 'tail risk'
    statistic for dependency lengths, analogous to its use for insurance losses or extreme rainfall.
- term: Head-finality / typological covariates
  definition: >-
    Morphosyntactic properties of a language extracted from UD morphological annotations and typological databases (WALS/Grambank):
    whether heads systematically follow their dependents (OV-type order), the size/productivity of the case-marking system,
    and the degree of word-order flexibility — all previously linked to MDD and hypothesized here to also predict tail shape.
summary: >-
  Instead of measuring dependency-length minimization by its mean (as all prior UD-wide studies do), this hypothesis applies
  extreme-value peaks-over-threshold statistics to fit a tail-risk shape parameter to dependency-length distributions across
  UD treebanks, testing whether spoken language and typologically 'harder' languages minimize catastrophic long-distance dependencies
  specifically, in a way plain mean-distance measures miss or contradict.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.
